# ChatApp
In this app, you could post and retrieve messages from anyone close to you. Not only you can chat anonymously and publicly with everybody at a location, but you can then engage in private conversations with any one of the people close to you. 
The app will have two activities.  The main activity lets you do public, anonymous chat.  If you select any message, you can then engage in private chat with the author of that message.
